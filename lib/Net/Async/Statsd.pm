=head1 NAME

Net::Async::Statsd - asynchronous API for Etsy's statsd protocol

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Future;
 use IO::Async::Loop;
 use Net::Async::Statsd::Client;
 my $loop = IO::Async::Loop->new;
 $loop->add(my $statsd = Net::Async::Statsd::Client->new(
   host => 'localhost',
   port => 3001,
 ));
 Future->needs_all(
  $statsd->timing(
   'some.task' => 133,
  ),
  $statsd->gauge(
   'some.value' => 80,
  )
 )->get;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides an asynchronous API for statsd.

You probably wanted the client implementation - see L<Net::Async::Statsd::Client>.
There's a basic server implementation in L<Net::Async::Statsd::Server>, note that
this does little more than accept traffic and raise events.

If you're not using L<IO::Async>, this module is probably not what you wanted.
See L<Net::Statsd> instead.
